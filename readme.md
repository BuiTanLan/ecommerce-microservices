## Application Structure

In this application I used a [mediator pattern](https://dotnetcoretutorials.com/2019/04/30/the-mediator-pattern-in-net-core-part-1-whats-a-mediator/) with using [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) library in my controllers for a clean and [thin controller](https://codeopinion.com/thin-controllers-cqrs-mediatr/), also instead of using and injecting a `application service` class in our controller, we just inject a mediator class, because after some times our controller will depends to different services and this breaks single responsibility principle.

Mediator mediate between objects and prevent direct coupling between objects, and objects could communicate each other with sending some message through mediator as a gateway. Here We use mediator pattern to manage the delivery of messages to handlers. For example in our controllers we create a command and send it to mediator and mediator will route our command to a specific command handler in application layer.

One of the advantages behind the [mediator pattern](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2014/09/09/tackling-cross-cutting-concerns-with-a-mediator-pipeline/) is that it allows us to define some pipelines of activities for requests on top of our mediator for doing some cross cutting concerns that brings [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) and [Don't Repeat Yourself principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) in our application.

For implementing these pipelines in our mediator to handle cross-cutting concerns we use MediatR libraries and its [Pipeline Behaviors](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR/wiki/Behaviors) or we can create some [MediatR Decorators](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2014/09/09/tackling-cross-cutting-concerns-with-a-mediator-pipeline/) as our pipelines.

Also in this project I used [vertical slice architecture](https://jimmybogard.com/vertical-slice-architecture/) or [Restructuring to a Vertical Slice Architecture](https://codeopinion.com/restructuring-to-a-vertical-slice-architecture/) also I used [feature folder structure](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/feature-folders/) in this project.

- We treat each request as a distinct use case or slice, encapsulating and grouping all concerns from front-end to back.
- When We adding or changing a feature in an application in n-tire architecture, we are typically touching many different "layers" in an application. we are changing the user interface, adding fields to models, modifying validation, and so on. Instead of coupling across a layer, we couple vertically along a slice and each change affects only one slice.
- We `Minimize coupling` `between slices`, and `maximize coupling` `in a slice`.
- With this approach, each of our vertical slices can decide for itself how to best fulfill the request. New features only add code, we're not changing shared code and worrying about side effects. For implementing vertical slice architecture using cqrs pattern is a good match.

Also here I used [CQRS](https://www.eventstore.com/cqrs-pattern) for decompose my features to very small parts that makes our application:

- maximize performance, scalability and simplicity.
- adding new feature to this mechanism is very easy without any breaking change in other part of our codes. New features only add code, we're not changing shared code and worrying about side effects.
- easy to maintain and any changes only affect on one command or query (or a slice) and avoid any breaking changes on other parts
- it gives us better separation of concerns and cross cutting concern (with help of mediatr behavior pipelines) in our code instead of a big service class for doing a lot of things.

With using CQRS, our code will be more aligned with [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), especially with:

- [Single Responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle) rule - because logic responsible for a given operation is enclosed in its own type.
- [Open-Closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle) rule - because to add new operation you donâ€™t need to edit any of the existing types, instead you need to add a new file with a new type representing that operation.

We cut each business functionality into some vertical slices, and inner each of this slices we have [technical folders structure](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/feature-folders/) specific to that feature (command, handlers, infrastructure, repository, controllers, ...). In Our CQRS pattern each command/query handler is a separate slice. This is where you can reduce coupling between layers. Each handler can be a separated code unit, even copy/pasted. Thanks to that, we can tune down the specific method to not follow general conventions (e.g. use custom SQL query or even different storage). In a traditional layered architecture, when we change the core generic mechanism in one layer, it can impact all methods.

For checking `validation rules` we use two type of validation:
- [Data Validation](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/rest-api-data-validation/): Data validation verify data items which are coming to our application from external sources and check if theirs values are acceptable but Business rules validation is a more broad concept and more close to how business works and behaves. So it is mainly focused on behavior For implementing data validation I used [FluentValidation](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation) library for cleaner validation also better separation of concern in my handlers for preventing mixing validation logic with orchestration logic in my handlers.
- [Business Rules validation](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/domain-model-validation/): I explicitly check all of the our business rules, inner my handlers and I will throw a customized exception based on the error that these errors should inherits from [AppException](./src/BuildingBlocks/BulidingBlocks/Exception/AppException.cs) class, because of these exceptions, occurs in application layer and we catch this exceptions in api layer with using [Hellang.Middleware.ProblemDetails](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hellang.Middleware.ProblemDetails/) middleware and pass a correct status code to client.
